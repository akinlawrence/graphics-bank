# Graphics bank small course project

## About the project
I wrote my own text graphics bank for the terminal using Python, where the user can put money, which is updated on the screen. The program works in such a way that you can select options with the arrow keys and accept the selected one with enter.

## Purpose of the Project
My idea was to utilize array to make a small grafical effect and write it from scratch using minimal amount of libraries. Even though the bank is the projects main idea, to me it about graphics. I wrote some funtions/classes that draws the windows and butttons.

## Usage
Note The program does not work if the terminal screen size is too small. The program warns about this just scale it bigger.
Controls: `arrow left ← ;arrow right →; ENTER`

Money can only be added using the numbers in keyboard `1-9`, i.e. (100-900)
